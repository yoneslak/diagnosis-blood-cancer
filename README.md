Introduction:
Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It occurs when there is an abnormal growth of blood cells, usually white blood cells, in the bone marrow. The bone marrow produces too many abnormal white blood cells that do not function properly. These abnormal cells destroy healthy blood cells and make the work of blood and bone marrow difficult.
There are several types of leukemia, including acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The type of leukemia depends on the type of blood cell that becomes cancerous and whether it grows quickly or slowly.
Leukemia can affect anyone, but it is more common among people ages 65 to 74, males at birth, and Caucasians. Many people think of leukemia as a childhood cancer, but some types are more common in adults.
Symptoms of leukemia may include fatigue, fever or night sweats, frequent infections, weight loss without effort, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen, easy bleeding or bruising, and small red spots on the skin. However, some people with leukemia may not have noticeable symptoms in the early stages.
The main causes of leukemia are genetic disorders, previous cancer treatment, exposure to certain chemicals, smoking, and a family history of leukemia. However, most people with known risk factors do not develop leukemia, and many people with leukemia do not have any of these risk factors.
Treatment for leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, age and general health, and whether the leukemia has spread to other organs or tissues. Common treatments often include a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and stem cell transplants.
There are several types of leukemia, including:
Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL):
The most common type of leukemia is in children, teenagers and young people up to the age of 39.
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML):
The most common type of acute leukemia in adults is seen mostly in the elderly (over 65 years old).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): It is the most common chronic leukemia in adults, which is mostly seen in people over 65 years of age.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML):
 It is more common in the elderly (most common in people over 65), but it can affect adults of any age.
Leukemia can cause a variety of symptoms, including:
 Fatigue or weakness
 Fever or chills
 Frequent or severe infections
 Lose weight effortlessly
 Swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen
 Bleed or bruise easily
 Frequent nosebleeds
 tiny red spots on your skin (spots)
 Profuse sweating, especially at night
 Bone pain or tenderness
The exact cause of leukemia is not known, but certain factors can increase the risk of developing the disease, including:
 Previous cancer treatment
 Genetic disorders
 Exposure to certain chemicals
 smoking
 Family history of leukemia













Summary:
The death rate from leukemia is 5.9 per 100,000 men and women per year, based on 2018-2022 deaths by age. The death rate is higher among the elderly. The percentage of deaths from leukemia is the highest among people aged 75 to 84.
Here is a breakdown of death rates by race and ethnicity:
| All races 7.8 |
| Spanish | 5.2
| Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native | 5.8 |
| Non-Hispanic Islands of Asia/Pacific | 4.3
| Black non-Hispanic | 6.6
| White non-Hispanic | 8.4
By the end of 2024, there will be an estimated 23,670 deaths from leukemia in the United States. Leukemia is the seventh leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
The following causes can cause the death of people with leukemia, including:
The most common cause of death from leukemia is infection, which accounts for about 75% of deaths. Bacterial infections are the most common type of infection, followed by fungal infections. Infections can be systemic or pulmonary, and the most common organisms isolated are Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Other causes of death from leukemia include bleeding, often due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or disseminated intravascular coagulation, and organ failure. Cardiovascular mortality is also one of the important causes of death in people with chronic myeloid leukemia.
In addition, patients with leukemia may die from complications related to their treatment, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in people who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplants.
It is worth noting that the causes of death from leukemia can be different depending on the type of leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have different causes of death compared to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid. blood cancer (CML).
Medical science has made significant progress in dealing with blood cancer. Immunotherapy has been a game changer in leukemia care and treatment. Bispecific antibodies that bind to both the surface of cancer cells and immune T cells have shown efficacy and safety in clinical trials. CAR T cell therapy, which reprograms a patient's T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells, has been used to treat blood cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma.
Researchers have also developed a potentially "universal" CAR T-cell therapy that could treat almost any blood cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This approach uses a newer form of CRISPR gene-editing technology, called base editing, to engineer healthy hematopoietic stem cells and give patients healthy blood and immune systems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered the field of leukemia. Artificial intelligence has been used to support the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For example, AI can analyze high-resolution microscopic images of bone marrow smears to predict the genetic characteristics of AML, enabling more accurate treatment decisions. In addition, artificial intelligence has been used to improve flow cytometry analysis, which is a technique used to analyze the physical and chemical properties of single cells. AI can help identify patients with AML and B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with high accuracy, and can also classify physiological cells.
Artificial intelligence has also been used to analyze the genetic data of patients with AML to determine whether they respond to various drug treatments. This can help identify the most effective treatment options for individual patients. In addition, AI has the potential to improve analysis efficiency and prevent interpretation bias, making it a valuable tool in the fight against leukemia.
In this research, we intend to diagnose leukemia by examining the behaviors and changes in gene expression in dendritic cells (DC) in order to prevent its progression to other cells and tissues of the body. Dendritic cells are considered as an immune checkpoint and checkpoint in the body. which react against any dangerous factor for cells. For this reason, we can react to the diagnosis of leukemia by studying the changes of DC cells in the body.
In this research, it has been tried to use deep learning step by step. In this way, we convert the scanned images into Panda data in Python and analyze them as an image matrix. In this analysis, at the end, we will also have a visualization of gene expression behaviors, giving us a result of 0 or 1. It means malignancy and the further we move away from the infected cell, it decreases to zero. and returns a benign result.






Blood cell:
 Blood cells are created from hematopoietic stem cells and are formed in the bone marrow through a highly regulated hematopoietic process. Hematopoietic stem cells are able to transform into red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
Blood is a specialized body fluid. It has four main components: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Blood has various functions, including the following:
1. Transfer of oxygen and nutrients to the lungs and tissues
2. Formation of blood clots to prevent excess blood loss
3. Carrier of cells and antibodies that fight infection
4. Bringing waste materials to the kidneys and liver, which purify and clean the blood
5. Adjust body temperature
An average adult human has more than 5 quarts (6 L) of blood in their body. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to living cells and removes waste products. It also provides immune cells to fight infections and contains platelets that can form a plug in a damaged blood vessel to prevent blood loss.
Through the circulatory system, the blood adapts to the needs of the body. When you exercise, your heart pumps harder and faster to deliver more blood, and therefore oxygen, to your muscles. During infection, the blood brings more immune cells to the site of infection, where they gather to fight off harmful invaders.
All these functions make blood a precious liquid. Each year in the United States, 30 million units of blood components are given to patients who need them. Blood is considered so precious that it is called "red gold" because the cells and proteins in it can be sold for more than the same weight of gold.
